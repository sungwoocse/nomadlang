| 0:00:00 | If whatever you askadio bot r crowdsell  Be.  Hands.  Also, I don't want to be able to do the available technologies  and we're going to work on the model.  Oh, and also on the Excel.  So the deep version, we are serving a very, very rapid program set.  So I don't really intend to stage my work, because they're acting, you know,  and they also start now.  So, all of them are being served, all of these, right? |
| 0:01:00 | So, that has a very true, because, you know, for example,  how long your work will be at the end.  We are, we are on issues with transportation.  So people were asked researchers were asked to buy a five-day-per-day-full sheet piece  and they started to land the budget.  And so then, we're like, oh, have a lot of computers.  Like discussing the capabilities and the capabilities of the computer.  After the exhibition on GD4, and that paper has also thrown you on very much.  So, we are serving a lot of radicals in this area. |
| 0:02:00 | So, a lot of people are really trying to stage two.  Honestly, I don't really want to cover our ends at the end, so I'm sorry.  It's like a very traditional way of introducing a different deep learning of structure.  And, um, what is important to understand is that the core idea behind socials,  for example, we talk about CNNs, we have to study the commercial filter and only things.  Think about our ends, we have to be in the password, but in addition behind, you know,  learn about the end sentence of what's, um, I don't really think sex on,  but I really focus on learning very, very detailed. |
| 0:03:00 | This is a track to the extent of the core idea behind it.  For example, it's a bit thicker because, um, they are, um,  so the terms on this are actually being used in different times.  So, we are able to model in each image, videos, sounds, um,  but if you push this, it just, all you can do is check this.  And, while the arc takes travel, travel is hard.  Our own starts at the end, and then we'll love our ends for the ends.  So, this is so much of a great idea to talk about sexiness, |
| 0:04:00 | travel from the model to our energy, most broadly, recent, okay.  The skill of the low, compared to games and harness, the model structure of the model,  is straightforward.  As we look at slightly wide arc, as slightly even, the high quality test,  is all just a bonus.  Why is the cost price a bonus because, um,  all our basic common sense is that as a model,  it's a classic class, the model is equal to,  through model of a class, and that's on the case,  and for us, models are very, extremely straightforward, simple.  Yes, yes, yes, you're able to scale itself up very, very well.  And that's the biggest reason, um, the travel model of the system, |
| 0:05:00 | a lot of, usually I and interested in travel,  that's very much, absolutely, historically,  a lot of work, uh, in, these, um, end, uh, what else?  Okay, now, so, um, there are situations,  and I think, um, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the high,  the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  weight, weight, weight, weight, the average weight,  the average weight, your average weight,  energy, and, um, for example,  the weight of your weight, energy is less than 20  and, um, weight of it, thehalten is less than 20. |
| 0:06:00 | The vision approach is on the right of the area.  I'll try to give this off and the other three,  close to the area.  Over, it's not going to be,  so it's not going to be the main questions that  you're going to see in the next video.  Okay, so I'll just round it out.  Don't go very far towards the base.  I'll be a higher-guess person,  like I can,  but I'll just do a great distance.  Don't go very far towards the focusing.  In the beginning,  the very detailed distance,  which is the second-guess behind the other one's instructions.  Try to understand, |
| 0:07:00 | but the main people wait for this course  would need to understand the four-again mind definitions,  or the key points of the course.  And,  okay,  the questions.  Yeah.  Okay, all the questions,  let's read them.  And, um,  really having the next call,  real words,  sorry, I'm not going to stress. |
