# Transcription of DL week1-1.m4a

 here because, my fellow HR ВладUP allows me to operate for how I present my talent out All of a sudden, I don't know. All 75 people, the familiar with those technologies, and we're going to go on my phone. So, I'm on. Oh, and also on the Excel. So, the deep version, we are serving on a very, very rapid progress. So, I don't really intend to stay too silent on the cellars because they're acting, you know, and they also come down. So, all of a sudden, they do their job. So, that has to be true because, you know, for example, on the other side, we have CPM. We are, we are on issues with transportation. So, people were asked researchers were asked to identify five capabilities of the chiefs. And they started to make a public space. And, um, some of them were like, well, have like, computers. And this was the capability to meet the capabilities of the chiefs. After the resolution of GD4, and that paper, um, has also thrown you on very much. Okay? So, um, we are serving a lot of, um, rapid growth in this area. So, a lot of the reasons have to stay too. Um, honestly, I don't really want to cover, um, our ingredients to us. It's like, um, um, it's a very traditional way of introducing the different deep learning of structure. And, um, what is important to understand that the core idea behind the socials, for example, or very talk about CPMs, we have to decide the functional filter, and only if you think about, um, our density has to be, um, we have to learn what intuition behind it. You know, very good, but in the sense of, um, what's, um, I don't really expect, um, but I'll be focused much on, you know, very, very good. This, um, is a very, very good idea behind it. And then, um, our first answer is, it's a bit difficult, because, um, they are, um, so the first ones are, actually being used in different times. So, we are able to model, in each, images, videos, sounds, um, and what the intuition is, and which is, all you can do is try to, and, in one way, our takes travel, travel is hard, our own structure is more than, and it moves up, our hands are the hands. So, this, it's so much the right hand, so it's actually the left hand. Traveling to model star, has energy, much more, the reach is okay. The skill, although, the parents' hands are hardness, the model structure, the model structure, is straightforward. As, um, there's hardly any line on, as hardly, the line on, as, um, just, um, is, mind, I'm surprised, um, our, our basic, common sense is that, as a model, it's, plastic, plastic, model is equal to, through, model, model, plastic, and, as a model, it's, as a model, it's, um, straightforward, simple. Yes, it's, yes, this scale itself, um, very, very, um, and that's the biggest reason, um, it's, um, a principle, oh, ah, of, usually, I and, interested in the principles, very much necessary. As hardly, I would order just, um, in the, um, and, um, and, um, what else? Okay, so there are some basic rules, and I think the identifying behind basic rules, basic rules, these vision first are very important. So, I'll turn on some key ideas between the vision approach and the people's approach. And the key of this approach is this identify in terms of everybody's estimation. The vision approach is identified as the yellow of the terrain. I'll try to give this off and the between those two areas. Over, it's not going to be, so it's not going to be the main questions that you have to deal with in the vision approach. Okay, so I'll just round it out. Don't worry too much about the race, I'll be a sharp-knit-scarcer, if I can, but I'll just do a great distance. Don't worry too much about focusing, right? In thinking, the very detailed distance, I think, is behind all the instructions. Try to understand the basic way forward and the forward would be to understand the four identifying definitions for the different balls. And, yeah. Okay, questions. Okay. Yeah. Okay, all the questions, let's start with the next call. Real words, I'll start with the next one.
