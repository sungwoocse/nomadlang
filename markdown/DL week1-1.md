# Transcription of DL week1-1.m4a

 the engine Why are you trying to correct me? Almost all, I don't know. Almost everybody spoke deep in the air with those technologies and we're going through a lot of my work. So, I'm on it. Oh, and also on things. So, the deep version, we are serving a very, very rapid program set. So, I don't really intend to stay time long still because they're acting, you know, and three losses from now. So, almost like the easier of this, right? So, that has to be true because, you know, for example, on a nuclear fuel, we have CPM, we have what we are on issues with transportation. So, people who are asked researchers who are asking if I am on five capabilities of the Chiefs, and they are doing a much bigger, and some of them who are like, oh, half of the regulators, and discussing the capabilities and even the capabilities of the Chiefs, after their submission on GPD 4F, and that paper has losses from you on very much. So, we are serving a lot of radicals in this area. So, a lot of the reasons to stay tuned. Honestly, I really want to cover our 16th launch. It's like a very traditional way of introducing a different deep learning of structure. And, what is important to understand that the core idea behind the launch, for example, we talked about CPMs, we have to study the commercial filter and only think about our enhance, we have to be in the password, but in addition behind, you know, we are going to put it in the same default. But, I don't really think that the focus is much on the very, very detailed. It's a very, very detailed point. It's a very, very detailed point. It's a bit difficult because, they are, so the short ones are actually being used in different times. So, we are able to model in-h images, videos, sounds, and what a few push-dads, and just all you can do is check this. And, one thing I want to show, check what this is, are all started for that, and a little of our enhance for things. So, this is so much of a great hit, it's so sexy, but transfer to models are a very, very short, recent, okay? The skill of the low, compared to CPMs, and the hardest, the models are actually a short street, or as long as it's hardly used by a lot, as hardly used by a lot of tests, or just a lot of tests. Mine was surprisingly good, because, all our basic, common sense is that, as long as the classic, one is equal to, two, one, and that's it. And, that's on the case, because all of us are very, very, very, very simple. Yes, yes, you're able to scale itself very, very well, and that's the biggest reason, the transfer to models, is that a lot of, usually I am interested in transfer, very much, absolutely, as hardly as a lot of our transfer models, and these, and, what else? Okay, that's what, there are stations, and I think, the identifying of, behind patients, patients of these, patients are very, very important. So, I'll try to cover some, here I can see, between, the patient post, the patient post, and, the patient post, is, is identified, in terms of, everybody has patient, and the patient post, is, or, I, is, I'll try to, give this, you Andiehan, those two experiments. Over, so, we're solving, so, we're solving, then going, questions, up there, or toâ€¦ Okay, so, that was around, helicopter, time, over, at home, so, I'm going to start with a kind of practice that I can, um, my thoughts to the greatest. Um, in the dogberry tall shop, you know, focusing, like, in the beginning of the very detailed distance, exactly, yes, behind, um, digital infrastructure. Try to understand, um, the main people wait for this course would need to understand the core idea behind, um, variations, um, for the third, the deeper boss, and, um, yep, yep, um, the fastest. Yep. Okay, all of the rest of the street up, and, um, really having the next call, real work, I'm sorry, I'm not stressed, okay? Applause.
